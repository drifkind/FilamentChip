# FilamentChip

This is an [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) program to produce a sample chip (like a paint chip) for a particular filament (or resin or whatever else your 3D printer uses). I wrote it to play with OpenSCAD more than anything else.

There are various [customizable](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Customizer) options:

* Size and thickness of chip.
* A text label (one or two lines), engraved or raised, near the bottom of the chip.
* A binder hole at the top, so you can attach a bunch of samples together.
* A top corner can be clipped off, because it looks cool. Maybe also helpful to find dividers in a stack.
